# Manual Deployment Trigger

If auto-deploy didn't start, here's how to manually trigger:

## Option 1: Manual Deploy Button

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click on your service: `Online_Tire_Shop_pro`
3. Look for **"Manual Deploy"** button (usually top right)
4. Click it → Select **"Deploy latest commit"**
5. Deployment should start

## Option 2: Via Events Tab

1. Go to Render → Your service
2. Click **"Events"** tab
3. Click **"Deploy latest commit"** or similar button
4. Wait for deployment

## Option 3: Check Auto-Deploy Settings

1. Go to your service → **"Settings"** tab
2. Look for **"Auto-Deploy"** section
3. Make sure it's set to **"On Commit"** or **"Yes"**
4. Save if needed

## Option 4: Create a Dummy File

If above doesn't work, I can create a dummy file to trigger deployment.

Let me know which option you want to try!
